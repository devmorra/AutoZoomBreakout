# AutoZoomBreakout

Prerequisites - Python 3, pyautogui

If needed, run 'pip install pyautogui' in your terminal to install the module

Start by going to breakout rooms, set the number of groups, and assign manually. The window must be visible for the program to find it, and on the primary monitor. Creates groups based off of a designated text file. See example groups.txt for an example. Names in the files must match the zoom participants. The program stops once the search bar goes away, you'll have to manually assign from there on. Participants who were in the groups but were failed to be assigned will be highlighted in red.
